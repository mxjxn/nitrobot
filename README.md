# NITROBOT
`OBEY THE NITROLAW!`

a mediocre bot for printing track information on plug.dj. 

#### Why mediocre?

`plug-dj-api` relies on puppeteer which isnt working reliably... for me, on Plug.dj. 

### Environment vars

all self-explanatory

* `PLUG_USER`
* `PLUG_PASS`
* `PLUG_ROOM`

### Run the script

PLUG_USER=your-username PLUG_PASS="your password" PLUG_ROOM room_name node index.js
